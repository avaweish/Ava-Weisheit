          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This project centered around creating and pitching an <strong>athlete brand</strong> modeled after the format of the TV show 
            <em>Shark Tank</em>. In today’s sports industry, athletes build their identities both on and off the field — and this project 
            challenged teams to research, develop, and present a comprehensive brand strategy for an assigned athlete to a mock panel of investors.
